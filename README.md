# commerceShop front end

This webshop was built as a way for me to practice using React with Material UI, practice working with MongoDB, and to learn more about AWS services such as lambda.

# Pre Reqs

1. [Nodejs Installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
2. [Follow the steps to set up the back end](https://github.com/rockaflacka47/webshopBackend)

# Setup steps

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Change your stripe key in CheckoutContainer.tsx
4. (optional) if you are also using my backend: Access to the MongoDB. Only Admin accounts are allowed to add items so once you create an account you will have to manually
   add `Type: "ADMIN"` to that account.
